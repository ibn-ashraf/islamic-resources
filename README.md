## Aqidah 

Aqidah is the creed that unites all Muslims. It encapsulates the core beliefs of the faith; for example God is not bound by space nor by time and Muhammad SAW is the final messenger of God. These are beliefs which usually every Muslim is familiar with but it is good to read through a formalization to strengthen your understanding and clear up any misunderstandings.

### Resources
* Aqidah Tahawiya - comprehensive and brief, summing up the vital beliefs of the Ahlus Sunnah in 105 points, written in the 3rd century AH.

## Fiqh
Fiqh pertains to a codification of the divine law derived from the Quran and Sunnah. It is mandatory upon Muslims to learn fiqh to the extent that they know what is forbidden and to perform all the actions they are required to do such as prayer, fasting, etc.

As a mercy, God has allowed difference of opinion in some matters, one manifestation of which is the four schools of fiqh: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali. Each of these schools of thought has respectable scholars and a long academic tradition. We do not disparage any and say it is valid to follow any of them. It is preferred for the layman to choose a single school and stick to it for ease and consistency. 

### Resources
* Ascent to Felicity - basic primer on the fiqh of purification, prayer, fasting, zakaat, hajj in the Hanafi School. Created by distilling a more expansive work by the same author (Nur al Idah).
